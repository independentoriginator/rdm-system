ToDO list
- Autonomous transactions: simulation by dblink and using available PostgresPro extension
- Static code analysis tool: plpgsql_check extension as an example
- Start using Jenkins
- Auto-generation of a standard view for an entity  
- RLS support
- Target table partitioning support
- Integration of a full user role permissions model 
- Materialized views incremental refresh: https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm
- Set application_name process attribute - solved
- mv emulation: truncation of an existing partition locks a reading process (an idea: create new partition and delete an old one instead truncation) - solved
- mv emulation: the main refreshing process is killed after some time interval because of it being non-active (an activity imitation is needed)
- mv emulation: custom "order by" expression in invalidated chunk selection within the triggers due to getting dead locks (for example, common period chunk, 
included months, quarter, year, should be sorted by year-quarter due to there is a year-quarter chunking applied in a slave data set)
- mv_emulation: dependent emulated views are not recreated and a column type mismatch can be occurred - therefore dependent views should be always recreated
(also there should be invalidation of the view due to a source table column type modification event).
- mv_emulation: ensure data availability during the deployment process if possible
- p_refresh_materialized_views: looping bug fix
- core system tables should be specially marked or placed separately so that they can be maintained during deployment rather than during regular maintenance
